    { q: "[INSTRUCTION]: Read the following passage and answer questions from 143 to 150\nIndia, as one of the world's fastest-growing economies, faces the dual challenge of sustaining economic growth while addressing environmental concerns. Its participation in global environmental protocols reflects an effort to balance these goals. India is a signatory to major international agreements such as the Paris Agreement (2015), the Montreal Protocol (1987), and the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992). Under the Paris Agreement, India committed to reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% by 2030 (from 2005 levels) and pledged that 40% of its installed power capacity would come from non-fossil fuel sources. This commitment has been enhanced with India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which now target net-zero emissions by 2070. Progress is visible: renewable energy capacity has crossed 170 GW, and large-scale solar projects such as the International Solar Alliance highlight India's leadership role. The Montreal Protocol, aimed at phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODS), is another success story for India. The country has phased out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) ahead of schedule and is now working on reducing hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the Kigali Amendment. This transition is not merely environmental but also technological, requiring industries to adopt alternative cooling and refrigeration systems. India has also aligned itself with biodiversity conservation goals. As a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, it has launched initiatives such as the National Biodiversity Action Plan and the People's Biodiversity Registers at local levels. However, rapid urbanization, deforestation, and habitat loss remain significant challenges, threatening species survival despite policy efforts. Critics argue that while India is making progress, it faces implementation gaps due to limited financial resources, competing developmental priorities, and the need for capacity building. Nonetheless India's consistent participation in global environmental frameworks demonstrates its recognition that climate change and biodiversity loss are transnational problems requiring collective action. The country's approach reflects both pragmatism - balancing energy security and growth and leadership, particularly among developing nations advocating for climate justice.\n\n India's net-zero emissions target year, as per updated NDCs, is:", o: ["2050", "2060", "2070", "2080"], a: 2, e: "Correct Answer: C" },
