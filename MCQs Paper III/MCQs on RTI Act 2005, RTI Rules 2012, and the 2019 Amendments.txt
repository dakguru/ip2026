A. 30 days
B. 45 days
C. 60 days
D. No specific time limit is mentioned for the disposal of the second appeal in the text provided.

**Correct Answer: D**
**Explanation:** *Note: This is a trick question.* The document mentions time limits for the **first appeal** (30 days, extendable to 45). However, for the second appeal, the text says "A second appeal... with the CIC or SIC" but does not explicitly state a disposal deadline in Section 19(3) snippet, unlike Section 19(6) which applies to the appeal process generally but is often interpreted for First Appeals. *Correction based on text:* Section 19(6) says "An appeal shall be disposed of within 30 days... not exceeding 45 days." This usually applies to the First Appellate Authority. The text provided for Section 19(3) discusses filing time (90 days). The strict text of Section 19(6) simply says "An appeal", but contextually in legal practice, 2nd appeals take longer. However, strictly sticking to the provided text: Section 19(6) is listed under Section 19. If forced to choose based *only* on the text snippet "An appeal shall be disposed of within 30 days...", one might choose A/B. However, standard testing on RTI distinguishes 1st and 2nd appeals. Let's look at the text:  refers to "An appeal" without specifying 'first'. *Crucial:* Standard RTI knowledge knows 2nd appeals don't have a deadline, but 1st do. The text provided at  is technically for the First Appellate Authority in the full Act, but the snippet here puts it under generic "Section 19 Appeal".
*Revised Question for Clarity based on text:*
**Q. 35.** According to Section 19(6) as per the provided text, an appeal shall be disposed of within __ days of receipt.
A. 30 days
B. 60 days
C. 90 days
